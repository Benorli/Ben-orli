## This site

This is a portfolio website for Ben-orli. I'm a data scientist coming from a computational neuroscience background. Machine learning has been at the centre of my work since my masters degree doing computational neuroscience. I fell in love with machine learning and have since moved on to commercial projects (check the projects section of this website for more details).

This website allows me to publish and share analysis and plots online. I am self hosting the site and running it on a free cloud server.

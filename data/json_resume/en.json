      "summary": "Developed the recommendation system used by EdPlace (www.edplace.com, over 100,000 users), using collaborative filtering to match users with worksheets. Improved performance was unanimously agreed on by stakeholders used on the site.",
      "highlights": [
        "EdPlace needed a worksheet recommender to engage users with more appropriate content, improving user experience, learning, and retention. Our team was able to provide this.",
        "Wrote Python functions to recommend easier worksheets when children were struggling.",
        "Used set theory to find a worksheet similarity measure based on student completion. This gave rich, user defined connections between worksheets, going deeper than subject and year.",
        "Optimised worksheet overlap calculation by finding pre-computable components, Python sets, and NumPy vectorization, resulting in a 120x time reduction, making the method usable.",
        "Accessed and cleaned large volumes of server data, working on AWS and using awswrangler.",
        "Fixed security and versioning issues for a team of 6, on our shared GitHub repository."

This will enable an article to be submitted for peer review (first author - finalising). Received a €600 grant from ANA to present this work at the largest neuroscience conference in Europe (FENS).",
      "highlights": [
        "Decision confidence is in all decision-making. High confidence errors are linked to hallucination. I helped to uncover how neurons in the prefrontal cortex carry confidence information.",
        "Ran PCA, and K-nearest neighbour models in scikit-learn (Python) on raw spikes for data driven prediction of waiting behaviour, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (0.2 s RMSE).",
        "Developed a method including optimal width Gaussian kernel convolution and change/slope detection used by the lab to find key events in time series, which will go into publication.",
        "Improved the trial data structure for the entire project. Loops became indexing, group-by statements, and matrix operations. Some processes previously taking hours took seconds. ",
        "Co-led a project with a budget of approx €1,000,000 involving several lab members, and a collaboration with a US lab, including a 6-month visitation, also hosting their visit.",
        "Contributed RNA sequencing data, discovering novel markers for brain pathways at CSHL, Long Island, US. Analysing differential expression in R to choose targets (> €1000 per target).",
